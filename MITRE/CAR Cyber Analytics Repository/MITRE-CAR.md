MITRE Cyber Analytics Repository is a knowledge base of analytics developed by MITRE based on the MITRE ATT&CK model. It takes corelations between models like D3FEND and ATT&CK to create a repository of various implementations in which detection and analytics on ATT&CK Techniques may occur. Detection rules may include pseudocode, Splunk, Elastic, Logpoint, Eql, Sigma, Dnif, and perhaps some other platforms.
