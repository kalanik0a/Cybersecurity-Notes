# Responsibilities and Possible Activities of an Information Owner/Steward in Relation to NIST

An **Information Owner/Steward** holds the responsibility of managing and safeguarding the data within an organization, ensuring that it aligns with the standards and guidelines provided by the **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)**. Here are their key responsibilities and activities in relation to NIST publications:

---

## 1. Data Governance and Protection
- **Establishing Ownership**: The Information Owner/Steward is responsible for the overall governance and accountability of the organization’s information, ensuring that all data is handled in accordance with **NIST SP 800-53 (Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations)**.
- **Data Classification**: Classifies data based on its sensitivity and criticality, ensuring compliance with guidelines in **NIST SP 800-60 (Guide for Mapping Types of Information and Information Systems to Security Categories)**.

---

## 2. Defining Data Access Controls
- **Access Control Policies**: Works with system administrators to define access control policies, ensuring only authorized users can access certain data. This aligns with **NIST SP 800-53’s Access Control (AC) Family**.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implements **NIST SP 800-162 (Guide to Attribute Based Access Control)** principles to ensure that the access to information is restricted based on user roles and responsibilities.

---

## 3. Data Privacy and Confidentiality
- **Protection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**: Ensures the proper safeguarding of **PII**, adhering to **NIST SP 800-122 (Guide to Protecting the Confidentiality of PII)**. This includes encryption, access restrictions, and other privacy controls.
- **Sensitive Data Handling**: Oversees the handling of sensitive data in compliance with **NIST Privacy Framework**, ensuring appropriate measures are taken to minimize risks associated with the exposure of private data.

---

## 4. Risk Management and Assessment
- **Risk Assessment and Mitigation**: Collaborates with the **Risk Management Team** to assess risks to information systems and implement mitigating controls following **NIST SP 800-30 (Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments)**.
- **Data Security Controls**: Ensures appropriate security controls are in place and regularly reviewed as per the **NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)** outlined in **NIST SP 800-37**.

---

## 5. Incident Response and Data Breach Management
- **Incident Reporting**: In accordance with **NIST SP 800-61 (Computer Security Incident Handling Guide)**, the Information Owner/Steward is responsible for reporting any security incidents involving data, coordinating with the incident response team to ensure timely action.
- **Data Recovery Plans**: Works to develop and maintain data recovery and business continuity plans following the guidance in **NIST SP 800-34 (Contingency Planning Guide for Federal Information Systems)**.

---

## 6. Ensuring Compliance and Auditing
- **Compliance with Security Standards**: The Information Owner/Steward ensures that the organization’s data management policies are compliant with NIST standards, including **NIST SP 800-53** and industry-specific regulations (e.g., FISMA, HIPAA).
- **Auditing Data Handling Practices**: Regularly audits the processes and systems that manage organizational data to ensure compliance and identify areas for improvement in data protection practices.

---

## 7. Data Life Cycle Management
- **Data Retention and Disposal**: Implements data retention policies based on **NIST SP 800-88 (Guidelines for Media Sanitization)**, ensuring that information is stored for an appropriate period and securely disposed of when no longer needed.
- **Data Integrity and Availability**: Ensures data integrity and availability are maintained throughout its life cycle, adhering to **NIST SP 800-53** controls for data integrity and availability.

---

## 8. Collaboration with Other Roles
- **Collaboration with CIOs and System Administrators**: Works closely with the **CIO**, system owners, and IT staff to ensure that appropriate technical and organizational measures are in place to protect data as required by NIST standards.
- **Third-Party Risk Management**: Engages with third-party vendors and ensures they meet the data protection and security requirements in alignment with **NIST SP 800-161 (Supply Chain Risk Management Practices for Federal Information Systems and Organizations)**.

---

## Conclusion

An Information Owner/Steward plays a critical role in managing data protection, privacy, and compliance with NIST standards. Their responsibilities include defining access controls, ensuring data confidentiality, mitigating risks, and enforcing data governance policies. By adhering to NIST guidelines, they help ensure that the organization’s data is adequately protected and that security risks are minimized.
