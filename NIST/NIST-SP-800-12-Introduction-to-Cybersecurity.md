# Elements of Information Security
- Its critical to understand the organizational mission and how each system supports that mission.
- Its also critical to define security requirements and roles for systems
  - Security can then explicity stated in terms of the 
  organizations mission

### Determining the impact level of a system
- FIPS 199
- NIST SP 800-30
- NIST SP 800-60

### Security Controls
- NIST SP 800-53
- there is no such thing as a perfect security solution, each security solution must be tailored to the organization adopting the security practices

### Information security roles and responsibilities
Understanding the roles and responsibilities which may be required within an organization to facilitate various processes defined by a standard is mission critical, especially in terms of compliance.

- NIST SP 800-37
  - Appendix D

### An integrated approach
- The document mentions using `Defense in Depth`, yet this may conflict with how Zero Trust architecture works.

### Security Systems Engineering
Information systems have many various processes which involve engineering and adopting lifecycles within other lifecycles inside an organization. This document focuses on the responsibilities of a Security Systems Engineer.

# Threats and Vulnerabilities

This section is mainly examples and does not go in complete detail on every type of cybersecurity threat, vulnerability, risk, response, or safeguard selection.

For more information on threat sources and threat events, see [NIST SP 800-30](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/30/r1/final)

NIST SP 800-30 mostly uses MITRE CAPEC for unclassified enumeration patterns. Today there is also ATT&CK and D3FEND.

## Examples of Adversarial Threat Sources and Events

### Fraud and Theft

Fraud and theft may be automated for financial gain for various reasons and can be identified through various risk management procedures as well as illegal activities.

Criminals may gain access to resources via: 
- Social Media (Phishing)
- Social Engineering (Spear Phishing)
- Advanced Persistent Threat (Malware Access Broker)

### Insider Threat

An example of an insider threat is employee sabotage

- Employee Sabotage may include but is not limited to
  - Destroying hardware or facilities
  - Planting malicious code that destroys programs or data
  - Modifying, Disrupting, Corrupting, Deleting data
  - Crashing systems, DDoSing systems
  - Denying access through various methods such as changing passwords

### Malicious Hacker

There are multiple types of malicious hackers, and some of the ones listed by this document are:

ChatGPT says that most of the malicious hacker groups are inherited from MITRE ATT&CK.

- Attackers
- Bot-Network Operators
- Criminal Groups
- Foreign Intelligence Services
- Phishers
- Spammers
- Spyware/Malicious Code Authors
- Terrorists
- Industrial Spies

### Malicious Code

Malicious code refers to viruses, Trojan horses, worms, logic bombs, and any other software created for the purpose of attacking a platform. 

- Trojan Horse
- Worm
- Logic Bomb
- Ransomware 

Other examples may include:
- Spyware
- Virus
- Destructive Malware
- Infostealer
- Remote Access Terminal (RAT)
- Backdoor
- DDoS Botnet
- Malware Botnet

## Examples of Non-Adversarial Threat Sources and Events

### Errors and Omissions
Errors of many kinds can occur within a computer system. Errors may go undetected if not checked for. Errors may also cause vulnerabilities and even crashes. Error detection through log analysis, machine learning models, EDR tools, and MDR processes can help bring insight to an organization. 

### Loss of Physical and Infrastructure Support
Loss of infrastructure support can cause all kinds of issues with life support. For example with the "Icey Goop" attack in Ukraine in 2024; which was a cyberattack on Ukrainian power infrastructure by Russia during Winter of 2024. This attack had casualties.

### Impacts to Personal Privacy of Information Sharing
Sharing PII with websites of any kind should always be done with discretion. Giving information to the public can result in possible blackmail for example.

# Information Security Policy

They list relevance to NIST SP 800-95, Guide to Secure Web Services, as an implementation of information security policy. 

Information security policy is largely defined by the needs of the organization in the way that it manages, protects, and distributes information. 

The document also talks about how NIST SP 800-53 has it's "-1" controls which designate that each of the 20 control families within SP 800-53 must have defined policies.

## Standards, Guidelines, and Procedures

### Organizational Standards
May define how a technology is used, or how a function is performed. They may define many aspects of responsibilities and how certain scenarios are handled. Standards are normally compulsory within an organization.

### Guidelines

Guidelines are improvements or instructions to improve the results of a task or practice. They are generally not required by law or organizational grading, but they can ultimately improve how a resource or system is utilized.

### Procedures

A procedure is a set of instructions on how to implement a process related to security policies, standards, and guidelines. They ultimately help an organization maintain compliance and get repeatable results for a business requirement.

## Program Policy

```
Program policy is used to create an organizationâ€™s information security program. Program policies set the strategic direction for security and assign resources for its implementation within the organization. A management officialâ€”typically the SISOâ€”issues program policy to establish or restructure the organizationâ€™s information security program. This high-level policy defines the purpose of the program and its scope within the organization, addresses compliance issues, and assigns responsibility to the information security organization for direct program implementation as well as other related responsibilities
```

The definition for policy is [here](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/policy)

```
  Statements, rules or assertions that specify the correct or expected behavior of an entity. For example, an authorization policy might specify the correct access control rules for a software component.
```

The definition for a [security program plan](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/information_security_program_plan)

```
Formal document that provides an overview of the security requirements for an organization-wide information security program and describes the program management controls and common controls in place or planned for meeting those requirements.
```

The definition for a security program or [IT Security program](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/it_security_program):

```
a program established, implemented, and maintained to assure thatadequate IT security is provided for all organizational information collected, processed, transmitted, stored, or disseminated in its information technology systems. Synonymous with Automated Information System Security Program, Computer Security Program, and Information Systems Security Program.
```

The `policies` of a `security program plan` within an `IT Security program` largely define the `scope`, `purpose`, and `responsibilities`, `roles`, and overall `objectives` of an `IT Security program`
