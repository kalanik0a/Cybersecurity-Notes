Overview 
Since 2021, India has faced an ongoing cyber threat involving Android malware specifically targeting bank customers. Threat actors initially distributed this malware through SMS messages containing phishing links, which directed users to download malicious Android applications. Themes such as credit card reward points and KYC updates were used initially to entice victims. 

In 2021, Cyble Research and Intelligence Labs (CRIL) highlighted this campaign, which specifically targeted users of major Indian banks using an Android infostealer. Recently, we have observed a rise in this phishing campaign. Threat actors have expanded their tactics beyond the reward points, and KYC update themes to include themes related to utility bill payments and government schemes. Notably, there has been a shift from sending phishing messages via SMS to using WhatsApp messages in this campaign.
