BRATISLAVA, MONTREAL — January 18, 2022 — ESET researchers have uncovered recent campaigns and an updated threat arsenal of the infamous APT group Donot Team (also known as APT-C-35 and SectorE02). According to research findings, the group is very persistent and has consistently targeted the same organizations for at least the last two years. For this research, ESET monitored Donot Team for more than a year from September 2020 to October 2021. According to ESET telemetry, the APT group focuses on a small number of targets primarily in South Asia — Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Nepal. However, targeting embassies of these countries in other regions, such as the Middle East, Europe, North America, and Latin America, is not outside the group’s realm. These attacks are focused on government and military organizations, Ministries of Foreign Affairs, and embassies and are motivated by cyberespionage.
