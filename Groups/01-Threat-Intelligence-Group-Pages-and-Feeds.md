# MITRE ATT&CK Groups Page

https://attack.mitre.org/groups/

```
Groups are activity clusters that are tracked by a common name in the security community. Analysts track these clusters using various analytic methodologies and terms such as threat groups, activity groups, and threat actors. Some groups have multiple names associated with similar activities due to various organizations tracking similar activities by different names. Organizations' group definitions may partially overlap with groups designated by other organizations and may disagree on specific activity.

For the purposes of the Group pages, the MITRE ATT&CK team uses the term Group to refer to any of the above designations for an adversary activity cluster. The team makes a best effort to track overlaps between names based on publicly reported associations, which are designated as “Associated Groups” on each page (formerly labeled “Aliases”), because we believe these overlaps are useful for analyst awareness. We do not represent these names as exact overlaps and encourage analysts to do additional research.

Groups are mapped to publicly reported technique use and original references are included. The information provided does not represent all possible technique use by Groups, but rather a subset that is available solely through open source reporting. Groups are also mapped to reported Software used and attributed Campaigns, and related techniques for each are tracked separately on their respective pages.

The eCrime ecosystem is an active and diffuse economy of financially motivated entities who engage in myriad criminal activities in order to generate revenue. With the eCrime Index (ECX), CrowdStrike’s Intelligence team maintains a composite score to track changes to this ecosystem, including changes in eCrime activity, risk and related costs.

Nation-state adversaries pose an elevated threat to our national security. These adversaries are known for their advanced persistent threat (APT) activity:

The [Chinese government](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/cyber-threats-and-advisories/nation-state-cyber-actors/china)—officially known as the People’s Republic of China (PRC)—engages in malicious cyber activities to pursue its national interests including [infiltrating critical infrastructure networks](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-144a).

The [Russian government](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/cyber-threats-and-advisories/advanced-persistent-threats/russia)—officially known as the Russian Federation—engages engages in malicious cyber activities to enable broad-scope cyber espionage, to suppress certain social and political activity, to steal intellectual property, and to harm regional and international adversaries.

The [North Korean government](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/cyber-threats-and-advisories/advanced-persistent-threats/north-korea)—officially known as the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK)—employs malicious cyber activity to collect intelligence, conduct attacks, and generate revenue.

The [Iranian government](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/cyber-threats-and-advisories/advanced-persistent-threats/iran)—officially known as the Islamic Republic of Iran—has exercised its increasingly sophisticated cyber capabilities to suppress certain social and political activity, and to harm regional and international adversaries.
