# Goals of Malware Analysis
1. To generate `IoC` or indicators of compromise
2. To generate host-based signatures of malware; such as `file or memory hashes`
3. To generate `network signatures` which may characterize the effects of malware on a system

# Malware Analysis Techniques
## Static Analysis - Analyzing the malware without running it
### Basic Static Analysis
Using tools without debugging or pulling apart the malware. Such as running the `strings` command or using `peid` , `pestudio`, `CFFExplorer` or other tools to get signatures like `hashes` to determine characteristics about the malware. These techniques do not work for sophisticated malware. 
### Advanced Static Analysis
Using tools like unpackers, disassemblers, reverse-engineering tools, and decompiling tools  to produce code which otherwise may be contained in a binary or software "package". By using these tools one may be able to get either the source code; or other packages within the malware. For example a virus may contain a binary payload which is also packed and employs anti-reversing techniques such as debugger evasion.

## Dynamic Analysis - Analyzing the malware by running the malware
### Basic Dynamic Analysis
This involves basic profiling of characteristics of malware in ways that can determine behavior or things like created files, registry keys, libraries, device nodes, or other things like hashes produced by payloads. Ultimately, this process involves things like auditing or logging to profile the execution of the malware. Tools like `procexp`, `autoruns`, `ANY.RUN sandbox`, `Cuckoo Sandbox`, or other recording tools.
### Advanced Dynamic Analysis
This may involve things like memory capture and profiling with tools like `Volatility`, or producing network capture information such as `INetSim`, or `honeypots` on a network which the malware may target. This may be more effective with things like contained network traffic replays. 

## Reverse Analysis - Turning execution code into source code or human-readable code
Reverse analysis may be static or dynamic, advanced or basic. The technique itself is determined by the level of obfuscation, complexity, entropy, or other characteristics which determine the course of action to take when analyzing malware.
