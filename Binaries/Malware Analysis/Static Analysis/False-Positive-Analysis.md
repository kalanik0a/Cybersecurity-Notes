# Analyzing False Positives

For example, a repository like DependencyChecker from OWASP contains a file called evil.zip which uses the documented Zip-Slip vulnerability to place a folder within temp, but the test file expects the extracted folder to be within /tmp. Now this may behave differently on different OSes as well. But lets break it down.

## Cloning the repository

## Inspecting the directory with `WinDirStat`

- Open WinDirStat
- Select the folder you want to scan
- Scan the folder
- Go through the file tree and view information about files.
- Note that `evil.zip` is in `DependencyChecker\core\src\test\resources\`

## Noting the suspicious filename
```
seanlum@Mitobox:/mnt/d/Code/DependencyCheck$ find . -name evil.zip
./core/src/test/resources/evil.zip
```
## Testing evil.zip

## Analyzing evil.zip with `unzip -l`

```sh
seanlum@Mitobox:/mnt/d/Code/DependencyCheck/core/src/test/resources$ unzip -l evil.zip
Archive:  evil.zip
  Length      Date    Time    Name
---------  ---------- -----   ----
       20  2018-04-15 22:04   ../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../tmp/evil.txt
---------                     -------
       20                     1 file
```
## Extracting the payload with `unzip -d`
```
seanlum@Mitobox:$ unzip evil.zip '../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../tmp/evil.txt' -d ~/evil.txt
Archive:  evil.zip
warning:  skipped "../" path component(s) in ../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../tmp/evil.txt
 extracting: /home/seanlum/evil.txt/tmp/evil.txt
```

## Examining the extraction folder with `tree`
```
seanlum@Mitobox:$ ls ~/evil.txt
tmp
seanlum@Mitobox:$ tree ~/evil.txt/
/home/seanlum/evil.txt/
└── tmp
    └── evil.txt

1 directory, 1 file
```
## Determining File Type with `file`
```
seanlum@Mitobox:$ file ~/evil.txt/tmp/evil.txt
/home/seanlum/evil.txt/tmp/evil.txt: ASCII text
```
## Examining the contents of the payload with `cat`
```
seanlum@Mitobox:$ cat ~/evil.txt/tmp/evil.txt
this is an evil one
```
## Code that executes `evil.zip`

After checking some code about where commits came from in the repository, I found this Git commit on the repository

## What does this mean?

Well, this test is meant to run on Linux, and the code will extract to `/tmp` and we can see that the test case is checking for `getSettings().getTempDirectory()` which will evaluate to `/tmp` on most Linux distributions.

### Possible Bugs

If the evil.zip file does not have code to work on Microsoft Windows

![](./files/7zip-evil-zip-slip-no-work-on-windows.png)

As we can see, in Windows, even in 7zip, there is no code to execute differently on Windows. This test will only work on systems where the temporary directory is in the path `/tmp`, on any other system the test will fail.

## Security Implications

### Linux
#### if `/tmp` exists, the test will pass
#### `/tmp` should be cleared of `evil.txt`

### Windows

On Windows, the files don't extract anywhere.

## Actual payload of the file
```
this is an evil one
```

# The test result is a false positive
Considering the payload just delivers a .txt file within an expected directory, this could be viewed as a false positive. However, if you don't want exploits running in your system, that's a file traversal issue. Some antivirus on Linux may flag this.
