# My question
```
Is it true, that if someone made a compiled signature format that was "closed source signatures" then essentially a corpus of compiled signature data could be dropped by a platform like artifactory into a CI server where feature extraction can be abstracted by AI? And then the AI operating on the siloed artifactory package update data could then export a behavioral analysis neural net file that could be sent to a public repository to be merged into a larger LVVM that is synchronized in global access, and then have CI commit cycles arranging new versions of the LVVM to contain the new LM that was exported by NN from the CI server running from artifactory? And then that LVVM could be updated on all hosts with a file transfer api or series of REST requests and payloads for patching the LM?

# Managing Closed-Source Security Signatures with AI and CI Pipelines

## 1. Compiled Closed-Source Signature Format
- Security signatures are in a compiled format, making them "closed source" and protecting proprietary or sensitive information. 
- A platform like **Artifactory** could manage these compiled signatures, storing them as artifacts. Artifactory would serve as a central repository, versioning, managing dependencies, and pushing updates as necessary.

## 2. Feature Extraction with AI
- Once the compiled signatures are deployed to a **CI/CD server**, the system could use **AI/ML** models to perform **feature extraction**. The AI could process the signature data (anonymized, obfuscated, or otherwise protected) to detect trends, patterns, or relationships in threat behavior.
- This AI-based feature extraction could analyze how threats evolve and abstract behaviors into generalizable patterns that are more robust and adaptable than the original signatures.

## 3. Neural Network (NN) Behavioral Analysis
- The **AI models** on the CI server, working with the signatures from Artifactory, could generate **neural network (NN) files**. These NNs would contain behavioral analyses based on the extracted features from the original signatures.
- The **NN files** would represent a distilled form of the security data, abstracting away the specifics of the closed-source signatures but retaining actionable insights on threat behaviors.

## 4. Export and Merge into a Larger Model (LVVM)
- The **behavioral analysis NN file** would then be exported from the CI server to a **public repository** where it could be merged into a **Larger Versioned Virtual Model (LVVM)**, which serves as the globally shared model.
- This public repository (which could be hosted on a cloud platform) would aggregate all NN exports from various sources, allowing for the synchronization and improvement of the **LVVM**. The LVVM could be trained on contributions from multiple parties, making it continuously adaptive to new threats.

## 5. CI Commit Cycles for LVVM Updates
- CI commit cycles could manage the process of **merging and updating** the LVVM with new NN data. These commit cycles would ensure that the LVVM is always up-to-date with the latest threat patterns and behavioral analyses.
- Continuous integration pipelines would allow the model to evolve as new NN data is committed, enabling rapid adaptation to emerging threats.

## 6. Deployment via REST APIs or File Transfer
- The updated LVVM could then be **distributed to hosts** using a **file transfer API** or a series of **REST requests** that pull the latest version of the model.
- This approach would allow all participating hosts to update their **local models (LM)** with the latest global insights. The LM could be a subset or customized version of the LVVM, tailored to specific environments or risk profiles.
- Hosts would patch their LM versions seamlessly via the CI pipeline, ensuring up-to-date protection against the latest threats.

## 7. Global Synchronization and Update
- This system ensures that all participating hosts (e.g., security systems, endpoint protection solutions, IDS/IPS) are synchronized with the most recent updates to the LVVM.
- The synchronization process ensures **global access** to the latest threat intelligence, behavior analysis, and protection measures, all while maintaining the confidentiality of the original closed-source signatures.

## Key Advantages of this Approach:
- **Scalability**: By separating signature extraction and behavioral modeling, the system can scale across multiple environments and organizations.
- **Security**: The original closed-source signatures remain protected, as only abstracted NN data is shared.
- **Rapid Updates**: Using CI pipelines allows for frequent and seamless updates to the LVVM, ensuring near-real-time adaptation to new threats.
- **Global Coordination**: By merging insights from multiple sources into a single, globally accessible model, the system benefits from collective intelligence and a stronger defense against threats.

## Challenges:
- **Complexity**: Managing such a system would require sophisticated infrastructure, including AI/ML pipelines, artifact management, version control, and deployment automation.
- **Trust**: Synchronizing NN data across multiple parties requires a high degree of trust in the integrity and security of the contributions.
- **Performance**: Real-time updates and deployment of LVVM to potentially millions of hosts require an efficient distribution system.

In summary, this system outlines a modern approach to leveraging AI in security signature management, abstracting closed-source data, and ensuring global synchronization of threat models. Such a system could be incredibly powerful for adaptive threat detection at scale.
