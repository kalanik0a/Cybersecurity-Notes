# Minimum Security Requirements
- [FIPS 200 | Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/200/final)

The E-Government Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-347) recognized the importance of information security to the economic and national security interests of the United States. Title III of the E-Government Act, "Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002," tasked NIST with the responsibility of developing security standards and guidelines for the federal government. This standard—the second of two security standards mandated by FISMA—specifies minimum security requirements for information and information systems supporting the executive agencies of the federal government and a risk-based process for selecting the security controls necessary to satisfy the minimum security requirements. 

This standard will promote the development, implementation, and operation of more secure information systems within the federal government by establishing minimum levels of due diligence for information security and facilitating a more consistent, comparable, and repeatable approach for selecting and specifying security controls for information systems that meet minimum security requirements

# Risk Management and Security Controls
- [NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 | Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final)

This publication provides a catalog of security and privacy controls for information systems and organizations to protect organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation from a diverse set of threats and risks, including hostile attacks, human errors, natural disasters, structural failures, foreign intelligence entities, and privacy risks. The controls are flexible and customizable and implemented as part of an organization-wide process to manage risk. The controls address diverse requirements derived from mission and business needs, laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Finally, the consolidated control catalog addresses security and privacy from a functionality perspective (i.e., the strength of functions and mechanisms provided by the controls) and from an assurance perspective (i.e., the measure of confidence in the security or privacy capability provided by the controls). Addressing functionality and assurance helps to ensure that information technology products and the systems that rely on those products are sufficiently trustworthy.

##### Abstract
Computer security incident response has become an important component of information technology (IT) programs. Because performing incident response effectively is a complex undertaking, establishing a successful incident response capability requires substantial planning and resources. This publication assists organizations in establishing computer security incident response capabilities and handling incidents efficiently and effectively. This publication provides guidelines for incident handling, particularly for analyzing incident-related data and determining the appropriate response to each incident. The guidelines can be followed independently of particular hardware platforms, operating systems, protocols, or applications.
