# Digital Artifact Services

Digital artifacts are pieces of binary code which may be stored in a stasis-like state, and can be offered at different levels of the infrastructure. Packages are also a vital part of software development and package management. Many of the platforms which run package tools are provided by digital artifact warehousing services. Considering that they are vital to how the internet builds itself, they are a good thing to think about when it comes to code security, and whitelisting updates on the backend. Especially for high-security DevSecOps situations.

Here are some of the digital warehousing services.
