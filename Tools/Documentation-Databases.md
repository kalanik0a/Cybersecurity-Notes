The IESG administers the process according to the rules and procedures that have been ratified by the Internet Society trustees [RFC 2026]. It is directly responsible for the actions associated with entry into and movement along the Internet "standards track," including final approval of specifications as Internet Standards. 

The IESG consists of the Area Directors (ADs) who are selected by the Nominations Committee (NomCom) and are appointed for two years. The process for choosing the members of the IESG is detailed in RFC 7437, "IAB and IESG Selection, Confirmation, and Recall Process: Operation of the Nominating and Recall Committees."

POSIX.1-2017 is simultaneously IEEE Std 1003.1™-2017 and The Open Group Technical Standard Base Specifications, Issue 7.

POSIX.1-2017 defines a standard operating system interface and environment, including a command interpreter (or “shell”), and common utility programs to support applications portability at the source code level. POSIX.1-2017 is intended to be used by both application developers and system implementors and comprises four major components (each in an associated volume):

General terms, concepts, and interfaces common to all volumes of this standard, including utility conventions and C-language header definitions, are included in the Base Definitions volume.

Definitions for system service functions and subroutines, language-specific system services for the C programming language, function issues, including portability, error handling, and error recovery, are included in the System Interfaces volume.

Definitions for a standard source code-level interface to command interpretation services (a “shell”) and common utility programs for application programs are included in the Shell and Utilities volume.

Extended rationale that did not fit well into the rest of the document structure, which contains historical information concerning the contents of POSIX.1-2017 and why features were included or discarded by the standard developers, is included in the Rationale (Informative) volume.

The following areas are outside the scope of POSIX.1-2017:

Graphics interfaces

Database management system interfaces

Record I/O considerations

Object or binary code portability

System configuration and resource availability

POSIX.1-2017 describes the external characteristics and facilities that are of importance to application developers, rather than the internal construction techniques employed to achieve these capabilities. Special emphasis is placed on those functions and facilities that are needed in a wide variety of commercial applications.

# W3C Standards

Web standards are blueprints –or building blocks– of a consistent and harmonious digitally connected world. They are implemented in browsers, blogs, search engines, and other software that power our experience on the web.

# WHATWG Standards

The WHATWG works on a number of technologies that are fundamental parts of the web platform. They are organised somewhat arbitrarily based on the preferences of those editing the standard for those technologies.
