# CSPT - Burp Extension for Client-Site Path Traversal Exploitation
Welcome to the CSPT Burp Suite extension, a tool that provides advanced capabilities and automation for finding and exploiting Client-Side Path Traversal.

This extension is a Burp Suite Passive Scanner. It reads your proxy history and looks for query parameters reflected inside the path of any other query. Please note that it will not find any DOM-based or stored CSPT until you use the canary token feature.

We appreciate your trust in this extension. Happy testing!
