# Models and Lifecycles

-	Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC): Starts with planning a new software project and stops when the software is retired.
-	IT Service Management Lifecycle (ITIL): Starts with service strategy and continues indefinitely, with services being continually improved or retired.
-	Project Management Lifecycle (PMLC): Starts with project initiation and stops with project closure.
-	System Development Lifecycle (SDLC for Systems): Starts with system initiation and stops with system disposition.
-	Security Development Lifecycle (SDL): Starts with training for a new project and stops when the software is retired.
-	Data Lifecycle Management (DLM): Starts with data creation and stops with data destruction.
