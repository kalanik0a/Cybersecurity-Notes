# Secrets Detection 

Services which provide knowledge and insight on packages, repositories, or software which you manage with Git repositories. This tool has the ability to scan your Git repository for things like private keys in SSL, SSH, or GPG. Or passwords, API keys which should not be released, internal dev packages, or other things which generally should not be released to the public. For example, if every hardware maintainer used secrets detection in their own infrastructure, attacks like PKFail would be harder.
