## MAEC (Malwarae Attribute Enumeration and Characterization)

https://maecproject.github.io/

https://maecproject.github.io/documentation/overview/

The goal of Malware Attribute Enumeration and Characterization (MAEC™), pronounced “mike,” is to provide a basis for transforming malware research and response. By eliminating the ambiguity and inaccuracy that currently exists in malware descriptions and reducing reliance on signatures, MAEC aims to transform malware research and response by improving communication, reducing potential duplication of malware analysis efforts, and allowing for faster development of countermeasures by enabling the ability to leverage responses to previously observed malware instances.

## STIX (Structured Threat Information Expression)

https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/stix/intro

What is STIX?
Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX) is a language and serialization format used to exchange cyber threat intelligence (CTI). STIX is open source and free allowing those interested to contribute and ask questions freely.

Why should you care?
Contributing and ingesting CTI becomes a lot easier. With STIX, all aspects of suspicion, compromise and attribution can be represented clearly with objects and descriptive relationships. STIX information can be visually represented for an analyst or stored as JSON to be quickly machine readible. STIX's openness allows for integration into existing tools and products or utilized for your specific analyst or network needs.

## TAXII (Trusted Automataed Exchange of Indicator Information)

https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/taxii/intro

Trusted Automated Exchange of Intelligence Information (TAXII) is an application protocol for exchanging CTI over HTTPS. ​TAXII defines a RESTful API (a set of services and message exchanges) and a set of requirements for TAXII Clients and Servers. As depicted below, TAXII defines two primary services to support a variety of common sharing models:

Collection - A Collection is an interface to a logical repository of CTI objects provided by a TAXII Server that allows a producer to host a set of CTI data that can be requested by consumers: TAXII Clients and Servers exchange information in a request-response model.

Channel - Maintained by a TAXII Server, a Channel allows producers to push data to many consumers and consumers to receive data from many producers: TAXII Clients exchange information with other TAXII Clients in a publish-subscribe model. Note: The TAXII 2.1 specification reserves the keywords required for Channels but does not specify Channel services. Channels and their services will be defined in a later version of TAXII.

## MITRE ATT&CK

https://attack.mitre.org/

MITRE ATT&CK® is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. The ATT&CK knowledge base is used as a foundation for the development of specific threat models and methodologies in the private sector, in government, and in the cybersecurity product and service community.

With the creation of ATT&CK, MITRE is fulfilling its mission to solve problems for a safer world — by bringing communities together to develop more effective cybersecurity. ATT&CK is open and available to any person or organization for use at no charge.

Enterprise Matrix

Below are the tactics and techniques representing the MITRE ATT&CK® Matrix for Enterprise. The Matrix contains information for the following platforms: Windows, macOS, Linux, PRE, Azure AD, Office 365, Google Workspace, SaaS, IaaS, Network, Containers.


## MITRE CAPEC (Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification)

https://capec.mitre.org/

Understanding how the adversary operates is essential to effective cybersecurity. CAPEC™ helps by providing a comprehensive dictionary of known patterns of attack employed by adversaries to exploit known weaknesses in cyber-enabled capabilities. It can be used by analysts, developers, testers, and educators to advance community understanding and enhance defenses.

On December 15th, 2023, the NVD plans to retire all legacy data feeds while guiding any remaining data feed users to updated application-programming interfaces (APIs). APIs have many benefits over data feeds and have been the proven and preferred approach to web-based automation for over a decade. For additional information on the NVD API, please visit the developers pages. Click here for more information on the NVD timeline.

Official Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) Dictionary
CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. Based upon the generic syntax for Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI), CPE includes a formal name format, a method for checking names against a system, and a description format for binding text and tests to a name.

Below is the current official version of the CPE Product Dictionary. The dictionary provides an agreed upon list of official CPE names. The dictionary is provided in XML format and is available to the general public. Please check back frequently as the CPE Product Dictionary will continue to grow to include all past, present and future product releases. The CPE Dictionary is updated nightly when modifications or new names are added.

As of December 2009, The National Vulnerability Database is now accepting contributions to the Official CPE Dictionary. Organizations interested in submitting CPE Names should contact the NVD CPE team at cpe_dictionary@nist.gov for help with the processing of their submission.

The CPE Dictionary hosted and maintained at NIST may be used by nongovernmental organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright in the United States. Attribution would, however, be appreciated by NIST.
