Zimperium zDefend offers an outside-in approach to mobile in-app protection. It’s an SDK that enables the host application to detect and proactively protect itself by taking actions on the end user’s device, even without network connectivity. The SDK leverages z9, Zimperium’s patented machine learning-based threat detection engine. The on-device actions are configured within the application. They can be updated in real-time without publishing a new version making it practical and scalable across large install bases. zDefend’s mobile RASP capabilities allow continuous monitoring, protection, and effective threat modeling within the mobile DevSecOps life cycle
