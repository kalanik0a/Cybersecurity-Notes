# Mekotio


The Mekotio banking trojan is  a sophisticated piece of malware that has been active since at least 2015, primarily targeting Latin American countries with the goal of stealing sensitive information — particularly banking credentials — from its targets. Originating in the Latin American region, it has been particularly prolific in Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Spain, and Peru. Furthermore, Mekotio seems to share a common origin with other notable Latin American banking malware such as Grandoreiro, which was disrupted by law enforcement earlier this year. Mekotio is often delivered through phishing emails, employing social engineering to trick users into interacting with malicious links or attachments.
