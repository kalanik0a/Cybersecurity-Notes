## [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)
A few times a year, OWASP will add a list of 10 vulnerabilities which should be safeguarded against as they are the top 10 observed vulnerabilities in the wild.

```
The OWASP Top 10 is a standard awareness document for developers and web application security. It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications.

Globally recognized by developers as the first step towards more secure coding.

Companies should adopt this document and start the process of ensuring that their web applications minimize these risks. Using the OWASP Top 10 is perhaps the most effective first step towards changing the software development culture within your organization into one that produces more secure code.

## [OWASP Mobile Application Security (MAS)](https://mas.owasp.org/)

```
The OWASP Mobile Application Security (MAS) flagship project provides a security standard for mobile apps (OWASP MASVS) and a comprehensive testing guide (OWASP MASTG) that covers the processes, techniques, and tools used during a mobile app security test, as well as an exhaustive set of test cases that enables testers to deliver consistent and complete results.
```

### [Mobile Application Security Weakness Enumeration (MASWE)](https://mas.owasp.org/MASWE/)
```
The Mobile Application Security Weakness Enumeration (MASWE) is a list of common security and privacy weaknesses in mobile applications. It is intended to be used as a reference for developers, security researchers, and security professionals. It acts as the bridge between the MASVS and the MASTG.
```

This program is still in beta as of 10/08/2024 and has a similar structure to MITRE ATT&CK, CWE, and CAPEC. It talks about vulnerabilities which may be present in applications and repositories.

## [OWASP Vulnerable Web Applications Directory](https://owasp.org/www-project-vulnerable-web-applications-directory/)
```
The OWASP Vulnerable Web Applications Directory (VWAD) Project is a comprehensive and well maintained registry of known vulnerable web and mobile applications currently available. These vulnerable web applications can be used by web developers, security auditors, and penetration testers to practice their knowledge and skills during training sessions (and especially afterwards), as well as to test at any time the multiple hacking tools and offensive techniques available, in preparation for their next real-world engagement.

The main goal of VWAD is to provide a list of vulnerable applications available to security professionals for hacking, offensive and defensive activities, so that they can manipulate realistic web environmentsâ€¦ without going to jail :grinning:

The vulnerable web applications have been classified in four categories: Online, Offline, Mobile, and VMs/ISOs. Each list has been ordered alphabetically

### [OWASP Juice Shop](https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/)
```
OWASP Juice Shop is probably the most modern and sophisticated insecure web application! It can be used in security trainings, awareness demos, CTFs and as a guinea pig for security tools! Juice Shop encompasses vulnerabilities from the entire OWASP Top Ten along with many other security flaws found in real-world applications!

### [OWASP Broken Web Apps](https://sourceforge.net/projects/owaspbwa/)

A collection of vulnerable web applications on a vulnerable operating system running Ubuntu.
