# F3EAD Cycle in Cyber Threat Intelligence
https://warnerchad.medium.com/f3ead-cycle-for-cti-e15a42194faa

# Find
- Find priorities for operations
- Identify the problem needing to be solved

# Fix 
- Find the information that is required
- Identify the flows of issues used to create the problem

# Finish
- Contain, Mitigate, and Eradicate the Problem

# Exploit
- Collect intelligence from the neutralizing activity, collect IoCs, TTPs used to cause the issue

# Analyze
- Analyze the data from the exploit step to understand the adversary and their TTPs
- Use structured analysis
- Identify compromises, and potential effects from the attack

# Disseminate
- Build a report and then share the information with the need-to-know parties

# Factoring F3EAD into the Intelligence Process
- First Planning and Direction
- Then Collection
    - Find
    - Fix
    - Finish
    - Exploit
    - Analyze
- Fix, Finish and Exploit are the Processing and Exploitation Steps
- Then Analysis and Production
- Dissemination and Integration

- Find, Fix, Track, Target, Engage, and Assess


```
Find: 
    Identify a target. Find a target within surveillance or reconnaissance data or via intelligence means.

Fix:
    Fix the target's location. Obtain specific coordinates for the target either from existing data or by collecting additional data.

Track:
    Monitor the target's movement. Keep track of the target until either a decision is made not to engage the target or the target is successfully engaged.

Target:
    Select an appropriate weapon or asset to use on the target to create desired effects. Apply command and control capabilities to assess the value of the target and the availability of appropriate weapons to engage it.

Engage:
    Apply the weapon to the target.

Assess:
    Evaluate effects of the attack, including any intelligence gathered at the location.
