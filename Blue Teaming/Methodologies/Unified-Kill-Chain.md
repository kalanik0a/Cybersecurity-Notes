# The Unified Kill Chain
1. Reconnaissance
    - Researching, identifying and selecting targets usingactive or passive reconnaissance
2. Weaponization
    - Preparatory activities aimed at setting up the infrastructure required for the attack
3. Delivery
    - Techniques resulting in the transmission of a weaponized object to the targeted environment
4. Social Engineering
    - Techniques aimed at the manipulation of people to perform unsafe actions
5. Exploitation
    - Techniques to exploit vulnerabilities in the systems that may, amongst others, result in code execution
6. Persistence
    - Any access, action or change to a system that gives an attacker persistent presence on the system
7. Defense Evasion
    - Techniques an attacker may specifically use for evading detection or avoiding other defenses
8. Command & Control 
    - Techniques that allow attackers to communicate with controlled systems within a target network
9. Pivoting
    - Tunneling traffic through a controlled system to other systems that are not directly accessible
10. Discovery
    - Techniques that allow an attacker to gain knowledge about a system and its network environment 
11. Privilege Escalation
    - The result of techniques that provide an attacker with higher permissions on a system or network
12. Execution
    - Techniques that result in execution of attacker-controlled code on a local or remote system
13. Credential Access
    - Techniques resulting in the access of, or control over, system, service, or domain credentials
14. Lateral Movement
    - Techniques that enable an adversary to horizontally access and control other remote systems
15. Collection
    - Techniques used to identify and gather data from a target network prior to exfiltration
16. Exfiltration
    - Techniques that result or aid in an attacker removing data from a target network
17. Impact
    - Techniques aimed at manipulating, interrupting or destroying the target system or data.
18. Objectives
    - Socio-technical objectives of an attack that are intended to achieve a strategic goal
