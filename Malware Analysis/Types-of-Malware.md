# Types of Malware

  
## MaaS or Malware as a Service

This type of service integrates multiple types of malware development concepts. Typically for a daily, weekly, monthly, or temporal based subscription. The buyer may be given various levels of access to a malware deployment or dissemination system for targets to be infected and collected. For example, there have been MaaS services which are used to harvest mass amounts of data to be collected for the darknet. These MaaS services may also offer various payloads of commercial malware to the user, so that they have a variety of tools to attack other users with. MaaS systems may be AI-powered, or even employ entire clouds of data systems for the sole purpose of leveraging malware attacks.
## PhaaS or Phishing as a Service

Phishing is one of the most common forms of malware attacks used today. This type of service uses well established practices of introducing specially crafted man-in-the-middle attacks, or emails which are used for spear phishing, smishing, vishing, or whaling attacks on unsuspecting users. Some of these PhaaS services may be employed to target entire organizations, or networks of businesses. And ultimately are used in combination with MaaS systems to later introduce malware into the network from the phishing emails delivered to compromised users.
## Malicious AI

In the modern age, even artificial intelligence has been wielded by users who hack the AI models such as LLMs (Large Language Models) or smaller LMs (Language Models) to be used for various malicious purposes. Sending phishing emails, crafting malicious payloads, writing exploits and viruses for their prompting users, or even target network systems and attack them with networking software. While this is an evolving type of tool. It seems that these are here to stay. Sometimes LLMs and LMs can also be poisoned and then later used to inject malicious dependencies within the code suggestions made by the AI, thus compromising an unsuspecting user. Sometimes the LLMs and LMs can also be poisoned to always place a backdoor within the system.
## Malicious Package Software and Malicious Domains

There is no doubt that malware is everywhere. And lately the attackers have been getting crafty. Sometimes package networks and packages are carefully laced with malicious dependencies. Other times legitimate software gets attacked in the software supply chain and laced with malicious scripts or malware. Other times package repositories are filled with typosquatting package suggestions which install malware on the unsuspecting user. This is later used in the software to either compromise the developer, or end-user of the software. Malicious domains function the same way with DNS. Sometimes a DNS record is spoofed, or an FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) is typosquatted, and then the unsuspecting user is then navigated to a fake website where the user is targeted with attacks like malvertising, phishing, or other attacks.
## Ransomware

Generally, this type of malware uses an exploit in the local system to take control of a computer. Then after taking control and obtaining high-level permissions, the malware begins to take a system, or files, or resources within a computer or a network, and puts them into a hostage situation. Such as locking users out of their computer and demanding a ransom. Or perhaps encrypting every non-system file in a computer and also demanding ransom. Typically it involves prohibiting access to desired content in exchange for payment of some kind. Though many ransom software situations do not result in the user getting access returned to them after payment. Many information security experts are trying to band together to not pay the ransoms.
## Remote Access Technology or RATs

If you have ever heard the term "a ratted system" this is what the technology means. Trojans, computer viruses, spyware, cryptominers, ransomware, downloaders and other types of malware typically include these binaries to provide network access to the malware. For example a custom compiled portable SSH binary, or an unencrypted network client like `netcat`, or a private VPN client which is used with a backdoor, or perhaps a SOCKS proxy, or IPSEC tunnel. Whether encrypted, or even a custom telnet client, or even just a custom TCP/UDP server with a REST API for downloading files and executing commands. RATs are perhaps the most common form of malware. However, not all Remote Access Technology is malware. For example, EDR/MDR/XDR/SOAR agents are also considered Remote Access Technology. It is all about how you use it and wield it.
## Cryptominer Bots

The purpose of this type of malware is to access a compromised system and use it to mine cryptocurrency. This generally is against the user's knowledge. It may persist within things like a videogame, a browser, or sometimes directly within a system. In large computer networks sometimes these systems execute on stolen instances of VPCs and are ultimately used to earn the attacker money. Sometimes malware may include cryptominers or cryptoware to store things like wallets or hashes.
## Cryptoware

Cryptoware malwares are typically used to allow non-conventional or clandestine means of communication, data storage, or file hiding on a target system. This generally can use methods of file encryption, stream encryption, network encryption, or steganography. The purpose of cryptoware may not always be to cause a ransom. In the younger periods of computer; cryptoware could be used for sabotage or systems destruction. Simply encrypting everything and not demanding a ransom. Also, cryptoware may be used by spyware to keep their data collection hidden or not probable to be read by a suspecting user. Examples may include malicious use of software like `steghide`, or obfuscation, and encryption techniques.
## Sabotageware or Cyber Weapons or Brickware

This is a specific type of malware with one purpose. Not to collect data, not to hold a system ransom, not to spy on a user, not to download further malware. No, this malware has one purpose. Disrupt, destroy, deviate, or compromise functionality of a system. This type of software is  extremely malicious. There is no intent to maintain persistence. Only to render a system inoperable or into a degraded state of functionality which prevents the target user from using the system, application, or program. These are generally referred to as cyberweapons. This may cause voltages to spiral out of control through rooted overclocking. Or corrupting firmware like the bootloader or BIOS or UEFI. This may also include disk wipers or RAID wipers.
## Scareware and Nagware and Adware

These types of malware typically have one purpose. To invoke a sense of fear or loss of control into the target user. This may use something like a rootkit or a remote access trojan to perform things like display a jumpscare image and play a scary sound at the same time. Or perhaps make a user believe that a system is fully compromised with an alert, making the user believe that they have already lost control. Nagware and Adware are a little less scary, but a little more annoying. Their purpose is to constantly interrupt the user session, forcing them to watch high counts unavoidable ads or notifications. Causing unproductivity, or a desire to make the problem go away. Sometimes adware may be used for malvertising, which is a method of sending malware on systems. Or the Adware may inject tons of advertisements into every page the user views. Causing their system to slow down or become harder to use. Nagware may cause an endless supply of notifications to be streamed to the user; filling up their notification area, and potentially causing the user to miss otherwise desired notifications.
## Spamware and DDoS and DoS Malware

Spamware can cause all kinds of data to be transferred in large quantities. For example, an email spamware may drive a postfix server or IMAP and POP3 server, causing it to send countless streams of emails. Malicious or otherwise; drowning the target in tons of emails. Sometimes it is a single target. Sometimes it is an entire contact list. Spamware may come in the form of voicemail, SMS messages, push notifications, email, or other communications. Whereas DDoS malware, such as the famous Low-Orbit Ion Cannon can be used by a single client to perform a network DoS  attack on a system. When multiple Low-Orbit Ion Cannons are used in a botnet, this causes a DDoS attack. This may also be performed on botnets with tools like `hping3`. Or other network flooding software. Sometimes web applications can be constructed to simply spam REST requests at a target web server, rendering the single-instance or regional cluster offline.
## Malvertising and Drive-by Downloads

Malvertising and drive-by downloads are used mainly for the purpose of propagating attack vectors on a digital system. For example some YouTube channels and other websites get their advertising scripts compromised. Then the attacker hijacks the advertisement display elements on the web page or web application; where the element is then used to serve up a phishing link, a downloader link, or worse a trojan that causes an exploit in the browser to be targeted with something like JavaScript. Drive-by downloads are similar. Where a script is injected into a web-page that causes a download to automatically be offered into a browser without the user clicking a link or actually attempting to download anything. In younger days of computer systems, sometimes malvertising and drive-by downloads would download malicious files within the temp data directories. Or onto a location like the desktop. There have been malvertising worms, however they are fairly rare. 
## Logic Bombs

A type of malware which normally contains second stage code which is only executed on specific conditions satisfied by the surveillance capabilities of the malware. Such as "if the user enters their password, then launches the command prompt, and then attempts to use SSH, then attacks the system". Or "if the user attempts to use FTP and access a specific website at this time, execute a payload". Ultimately this involves various levels of persistence, surveillance, and spying before the malware executes the payload. For example, one disgruntled employee wrote a logic bomb that took a system offline, and changed the network domain controllers once the user was fired. For example when the offboarding software terminates a workers software license, or deletes the user account or credentials from the system.
## Zip Bombs and Archive Bombs

These types of malware typically use practices such as replicating extremely compressed streams of data. Or the archive contains weaponized code which may generate streams of data within a system that ultimately fill up a filesystem or perhaps an entire disk or just a partition. Sometimes these weaponized archives even pipe out data from the random bytes generating device on the system. Or perhaps a single small archive which when fully decompressed fills the system with potentially petabytes of data. These may even be executed on embedded systems to render them inoperable. 
## Zipslips

This type of malware attempts to hide the spreading of malware by using a specially crafted zip file or digital archive to place files well outside of the target extract directory. For example if a user attempts to extract the zipslip into `/home/<username>/Downloads/extract`, the archive will then extract  malware to another location via path traversal to a location such as `/usr/local/bin` or `/tmp` where the file is later executed by the attacker. Sometimes this may also do a vector on Microsoft Windows like a shortcut file in the user startup directory, a batch file in the local file storage, and a database collection file in a network share. All files may even be hidden.
## Cracking Programs

Sometimes malware may also include things which circumvent things like licensing schemes, encryption programs, and systems hardening policies. These cracking programs can do things like install licenses into the operating systems or target applications. Thus making the user able to utilize the software or encrypted file or system when they otherwise could not. Cracking programs may also be made for specific vendors of software. Sometimes these types of software may even be used for making hardware usable when it normally requires an activation process or licensing install. Sometimes they generate serial keys, use root keys, install exploits in the licensing scheme, or even cause remote calls to servers to even trick them into giving a program a valid license. 
## Infostealer - Information Stealer

Malware which collects information from a victim's computer and usually sends it to the attacker. Examples include sniffers, password hash grabbers, cookie stealers, session stealers, security key stealers, security token stealers, browser data theft tools, credential theft tools, and database dump tools. This type of malware is generally used to gain access to applications, systems, networks, servers, accounts, such as email, banking, or systems administration.
## Botnet

A network of computers which commonly use backdoors or deployed agents, organized into networks. These networks are essentially used to perform attacks on other hosts or networks over internet or electromagnetic communication. Botnets may also include things like zombie networks, bitcoin mining botnets, DDoS networks, or mass-surveillance networks.
## Trojans and Banking Trojans

Trojans are as famous as computer viruses. But unlike a computer virus, they tend to be more stealthy. They typically target vulnerabilities from the network or hardware peripheral side. These vulnerabilities are then exploited in order to leverage a second-stage of the attack where further malicious code is uploaded within the target system. Later the trojan uses remote access capabilities or backdoor capabilities to provide access or data infiltration or exfiltration capabilities to the user. Banking trojans target secure banking systems such as SWIFT banking servers. Where the trojan is then used to steal money, files, credentials, and other data from the bank or digital system.
## Computer Viruses

A virus is a replicating piece of malware which ultimately involves user interaction of some kind, which in turn causes a system to become infected. Once infected the virus may cause "symptoms" within a system, such as alerts, harassment, or system instability. Such as causing all drivers for USB devices to become rejected by the system. Or perhaps periodically taking a system off WiFi. Computer viruses may also be more sinister. But ultimately the goal is to cause symptoms and to spread. By means like copying code on to removable drives which then infects a host system to infect more removable drives on other systems. For example, if a system administrator or network administrator had an unsuspected infected drive. And then that administrator loads that code onto their own system, or worse, does a routine flash of all computer BIOS or UEFI; then all those systems are infected. Then whenever the general end users use their own data storage devices, they may later become infected, and infect any system they come into contact with. This however is a little different from a computer worm. Which self-replicates, self-propagates, and may not even require user intervention.
## Computer Worms

These types of malware may perform multiple functions. Typically these malware may contain code which first targets a vulnerability, such as a network vulnerability. Then using a trojan or weaponized approach, the persistence gained from exploiting that vulnerability is immediately used to target nearby or adjacent systems which present the same, or other targeted vulnerabilities within the system. These worms may also contain droppers or even downloaders. The most dangerous type of worm is a root-level zero-interaction malware. Typically targeting critical level network vulnerabilities. Which in turn access root-level permissions, and install the second stage malware, which then is used to target the next system, and spreading the root-level compromise over the entire VLAN or other type of computer network. These attacks sometimes have what is called a heartbeat, and sometimes are used to deploy botnets. A worm may deliver a bot to a botnet on a compromised system with these exploits. Assembling an entire botnet without the interaction of an attacker; while the C2 server just collects bots to later use for things like mass-surveillance or DDoS attacks or mass information theft. While in the old days, worms like the `iloveyou` worm/virus was propagated through things like email. Simply opening the email caused the worm to send itself to everyone you have ever emailed in your client. Then those clients receive the same worm/virus, which performs the same action over and over again. 
## Spyware

Typically involving multiple vectors of malware; this type of malware is ultimately used to spy on users. While it may not steal information by primary design or purpose. The goal of the spyware is either to collect surveillance information, or targeted valuable information which serves the attackers needs. This may use infostealers like keyloggers, and sniffers. However the software may also record user actions, personal data, and also personal details about the physical life of the system or users affected by the spyware. This may involve software or hardware with code that may circumvent things like air-gapped networks by using transmission vectors or data collection staging. Spyware may also be used to record data from cameras, sensors, or auditing records. The purpose of the spyware may be used to monitor individuals, groups, or worse; possibly to compromise their safety, or reinforce it. Sometimes governments, organizations, or individuals use this to assure safety or monitoring of subjects.
## Antivirus Killers and Security Service Killers

The goal of these types of malware are simply to prevent a security program from performing its job. Thus opening the door to more types of attacks, or worse, completely compromising a non-secured system. For example, on GitHub there are many AV Killers which are used to prevent software like Windows Defender from loading. These may come in the form of shell scripts, compiled binaries, shellcode, and other executable code. They may also use packers, obfuscators, and encrypted data streams to evade detection by the target antivirus / EDR / MDR / XDR. Once the kill code prevents the security tool from running. This allows the attacker to compromise the target as they wish. And then use other payloads like `Metasploit Meterpreters`, or perform downgrade attacks or disable things like `Deepfreeze` so more possibilities open up for the attacker.
## Rootkits

Rootkits are typically a type of malicious code which may either fully implement a set of commands within a system that are outside of the standard namespaces which are observed by security software. They may emulate APIs or frameworks to avoid detection. Often using techniques such as drivers, kernel modules, and root-level data structures to maintain an undetected status by staying out of scope from antivirus software. This may also use code like downloaders, backdoors, trojans, and pivoting tools to further the next stages of the `ATT&CK Matrix` or the `Lockheed Martin Cyber Killchain`.
## Bootkits

A specific type of malware which installs persistent access or regenerative capabilities within a targeted system. Sometimes bootkits infect various parts of low-level hardware. And may target structures such as the BIOS, UEFI, or EEPROMs on the motherboard. It may also target data storage devices on network cards, writable memory structures on other circuits. It may also persist on things like boot sectors in the hard-drive, the MBR (Master Boot Record), the GPT (GUID Partition Table), or loader code for things like boot loaders (`LILO`, `Grub`, `Winload`). Bootkits may also keep things like downloaders or droppers within these sections of code. So when a user attempts to wipe away the filesystem or data structures to remove malware; the bootkit will reinstall the malicious code and attempt to run the downloader, dropper, or second-stage malware to regain access to the userspace or kernelspace environment.
## Launchers

A malicious program which is used to launch other programs used to leverage parts of the `Lockheed Martin Cyber Killchain` or parts of the `ATT&CK Matrix`. This may involve running tools which may be trusted by the local system. It may also be used to launch malware and further the effects of privilege escalation or perhaps surveillance activities. These tools may be trusted tools like `Sysinternals psexec`, but it may also include malware specifically designed to execute only malware. This may also be in the form of a malicious `bash`, `bat file`, `powershell script`, or perhaps `shellcode`. 
## Downloader

Malicious code which only exists to download other code. Other kinds of code which may be used with a downloader are things like `viruses` and `droppers`. Downloaders may be used to retrieve launchers, droppers, infostealers and other kinds of malware. A downloader is typically a first-stage malware. Like a trojan, the purpose is to allow initial access and compromise.  
## Droppers

A malicious program which has self-contained resources, or perhaps includes a downloader, or second stage payloads which are later used to execute other malware such as launchers, viruses, worms, or spyware. Droppers are typically like Matryoshka dolls or Stacking / Nesting dolls. The metaphor implies that as you get further within the dropper binary, you get different stages of a concealed malware. Typically this is used to evade detection tools and may include various stages of red-teaming goals, such as disabling encryption or antivirus or administrative policies before executing the final malware.
## Backdoor

A tool which enables attacker access with little to no authentication in order to execute commands or code on the system. Backdoors may also be implemented through vectors like `Downgrade attacks`, introducing bugs into a system or code base, installing malware which exploits existing vulnerabilities or zero-days on a system. For example, when someone says there is a backdoor in a web application; this typically means that a script was uploaded into an executable part of the webserver. Such as `cgi-bin` scripts which run TCP or UDP servers which persist as remote access tools. When someone says there is a backdoor within an encryption protocol, it may mean that there is some kind of way to break the encryption key, or session link to intercept data.
## Fileless Malware

These types of malware may come in many forms but ultimately do one thing. They run in a system by maintaining persistence in low-level hardware structures outside of the hard-drive or only exist in memory until the system is taken offline. These types of malware tend to be very discrete and are generally used by advanced persistent threat groups to avoid detection by signature-based and other traditional types of security products. Sometimes these malware even reside within the CPU cache.
