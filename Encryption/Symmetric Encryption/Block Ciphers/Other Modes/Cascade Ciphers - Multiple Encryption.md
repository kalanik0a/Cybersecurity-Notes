# Cascade Ciphers
May combine multiple ciphers in order to make the data harder to decrypt. Cascading multiple ciphers for added theoretical strength.

### Examples
- 3DES-EDE
- AES-Twofish-AES
- CTR-ECB mode
- CTR-CTR mode

### CMCC - CBC-MAC-CTR-CBC

### Usages
- High-security archives or legacy banking software
