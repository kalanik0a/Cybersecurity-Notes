# Using CAPA on Process Dumps

**CAPA** (Capability Analysis) can be used on process dumps. CAPA is a tool developed by the FireEye FLARE team that automatically identifies capabilities in executable files. While it is primarily designed for analyzing PE files, it can also be used on process dumps with some additional steps.

## Step 1: Extract Executable Sections from the Process Dump

You can use tools like **Volatility** or **Rekall** to extract the executable sections from the process dump.

### Using Volatility

1. **Install Volatility**:
   - Download and install Volatility from the [official website](https://www.volatilityfoundation.org/).

2. **Extract Executable Sections**:
   - Use the `procdump` plugin to extract the executable sections:
   - Replace `process_dump.dmp` with the path to your process dump and `output_directory` with the directory where you want to save the extracted files.

```
 volatility -f process_dump.dmp --profile=Win7SP1x64 procdump -D output_directory
```
  
## Step 2: Analyze Extracted Files with CAPA

1. **Install CAPA**:
   - Download and install CAPA from the [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/mandiant/capa).

2. **Run CAPA on Extracted Files**:
   - Use CAPA to analyze the extracted files:
   - Replace `output_directory/extracted_file.exe` with the path to the extracted executable file.
```
 capa output_directory/extracted_file.exe
```

By following these steps, you can effectively use CAPA to analyze process dumps for malware capabilities. This approach leverages the strengths of both Volatility for memory forensics and CAPA for capability analysis.
